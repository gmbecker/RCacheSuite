#This is a modified version of the redraw.recordedPlot function from the pander package by Gergely Dar√≥czi
#That package is licsensed as AGPL3
#The version in that package accepts only files which it seems to assume contain only a recorded plot in them. Furthemore if I am reading it correctly, the object stored in the rda file must be named plot ...

#We need more flexibility than that, and also would like to be able to redraw trellis/grid/ggplot/etc objects with the same function.
